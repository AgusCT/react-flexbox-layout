# react-flexbox-layout
Simple flexible layouts for IE9+


# Next steps

* add webpack config to be able to build it and compile it (see what stuff is not working and solve any building errors)
* build an example page and make it work with the current impl
* migrate the api to be able to use px or rems
* react-style? move it out? should not be used inside the render neither.
* make the gutters configuration be part of the settings of the component
* tests?
